## Project Title: AdventureWorks

## Introduction:

Welcome to my warehouse data analysis project! This data repository focuses on understanding inventory management processes, including the storage of goods, product lines, categories, and managing inventory flow at sales points. The goal is to develop strategies for inventory turnover and production prioritization, maximizing product availability at key sales points while maintaining safe stock levels at secondary points.

## Objective: 
The aim is to help stakeholders gain a clear understanding of warehouse data, enabling them to make informed decisions and improve operations. This includes monitoring inventory levels, identifying trends, and providing actionable insights to enhance inventory management strategies.

## Analysis Focus:

- **Inventory Overview:**
  - Track total inventory quantity, including finished goods, semi-finished products, and raw materials.

- **Product Count:**
  - Determine the total number of distinct products in the warehouse for better categorization.

- **Safety Stock Levels:**
  - Identify the number of products that meet safety stock requirements to prevent stockouts.

- **Reorder Points:**
  - Assess the number of products that fall below reorder points, indicating the need for restocking.

- **Out-of-Stock Products:**
  - Calculate the number of products currently out of stock to address supply chain issues.

## Tools and Techniques Used: 

- SQL
- Data Visualization Tools - Power BI 

## Execution Process: 
- Using Design Thinking, identify who will be the report viewers and put yourself in the shoes of the stakeholders to understand what they care about, what they think, and gather information surrounding their needs.

- Utilize 5W1H â‡’ This helps us visualize the overall picture of the problem and thus understand the issue more clearly.

- Data Collection: Gather inventory data from relevant sources and load it into a database.

- Data Cleaning: Use SQL queries to clean the dataset by removing duplicates and ensuring data consistency.

- Metric Calculation: Calculate key metrics such as total inventory quantity, product counts, safety stock levels, etc.

- Trend Analysis: Execute specific queries to identify inventory trends over time.

- Reporting: Create visualizations to present findings in an easily understandable format for stakeholders.

## Results Achieved: 
- Enhanced Data Understanding: Developed a comprehensive understanding of inventory dynamics, helping stakeholders effectively grasp key metrics and trends.
- Improved Inventory Management: Identified areas for improvement in inventory management practices, leading to optimized stock levels and reduced stockouts.
- Actionable Insights: Provided actionable information that enabled stakeholders to make strategic decisions regarding inventory turnover and production prioritization.
- Increased Stakeholder Engagement: Improved communication and collaboration among stakeholders by presenting data clearly and visually.
- Strategic Recommendations: Offered specific recommendations for enhancing inventory management, including adjustments to safety stock levels and reorder points.
- Skill Development: Enhanced technical skills in SQL and data visualization, improving the ability to analyze and present data effectively.
- Data-Driven Decision Making: Empowered stakeholders to make data-driven decisions that align with organizational goals and improve operational efficiency.
- Trend Identification: Successfully identified inventory trends over time, allowing for proactive management and better forecasting of future inventory needs.
